                    <img src="images\Eagle.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p>When you think of eagles, you probably think of the bald eagle, a symbol of pride in America.
                       Over 60 species of eagles live on the earth and only two of them live in the United States. 
                       Most eagles live in Eurasia and Africa. Nine species live in Central and South America and 
					   three species are found in Australia. The bald eagle, loved for its majestic appearance and 
					   flight, was common in America three hundred years ago. By the 20th century, it had been hunted
					   almost to extinction. The bald eagle has been protected since 1967 and is slowly making a comeback
					   – good news for a beloved American bird.

                    <img src="images\Ostriches.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p>
                    When you think of birds, you probably think of the small, charming birds chirping in your backyard.
					The ostrich, though, is bigger than your dad! Ostriches are the largest birds. They can grow 9 feet 
					tall and weigh over 350 pounds. Ostriches live in the African savannah. They can’t fly, but they’re 
					fast runners. They can run up to 43 miles per hour for short periods. Most of the time, they run at 
					around 30 miles per hour. Ostriches eat seeds, plants and grain. They also munch on insects and small animals.

			        <alt="birds"><h3>Parrot</h3>
                    <img src="images\Parrot.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p> You probably recognize large talking parrots found in some pet stores as parrots, 
					but did you know parakeets, cockatiels and cockatoos are also types of parrots? There 
					are over 350 kinds of parrots and they all live in warm places.Parrots live in rainforests 
					and woodlands in Africa, Australia, Asia, Central America, and South America. Parrots have 
					a special talent –they can imitate human speech. They’re not talking to communicate, but they 
					can say words and even sing.
