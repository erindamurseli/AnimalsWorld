                    <img src="images\Sheep.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p><cite>Sheep</cite> are mammals. They are herbivores meaning plant eater. Sheep mostly graze on grass. 
					There are over 1 billion sheep in the world. Sheep live in most nations around the world.
                    There are hundreds of different species of sheep. Baby sheep are called lambs.
                    Mother sheep give birth to between 1-3 lambs. Lambs are between 5-8 pounds when they are born.
                    Sheep are very social animals. The live in groups called herds or flocks. Most sheep live on farms or ranges.
                    Sheep have excellent hearing and good memories. Sheep can see behind themselves without moving their heads.
                    The lifespan for a sheep is between 6-11 years. A sheep is covered in a thick fleece.
                    Some sheep have their fleece cut or sheared in the Spring to make wool for clothing.
                    Fat from a sheep called tallow is sometimes used to make soap and candles.
                    Sheep milk is higher in fat, protein and calcium than cows or goat milk.

                    <img src="images\Dolphin.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p> Dolphins are sometimes thought of as the dogs of the sea because they are usually playful and friendly.
They’re also among the smartest animals on Earth. Dolphins are water mammals. 
Scientists believe they’re as smart as chimpanzees or dogs. They live in rivers and oceans, but they must come up to breathe air.
A Dolphin is a cetacean mammal, related to whales and porpoises. 
Though people sometimes think ‘dolphin’ and ‘porpoise’ are the same 
thing, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical
 features (Porpoises have a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth) and they also behave 
in different way than a dolphin does. 
Porpoises and dolphins share a common ancestry, being of the Delphinidae mammal family.

                    <img src="images\Bat.jpg" width=400 height=200> 
                    <p> A long time ago people used to think that bats were <abbr title="Birds without feathers ">BWF</abbr> . 
                    But now we know that there is no such thing as a featherless bird.  
                    We know that bats are mammals, just like people. Bats are warm blooded and they have fur. 
					Bats nurse their babies with milk. But bats are very special mammals.They are the only mammals that can fly (without an airplane!)  
                    Flying squirrels are mammals too, but they don't really fly. They jump from high in a tree glide through the air like a kite.
                    Bats flap their wings and fly like a bird.

                    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_loris" target="_blank">Slow Loris</a></dt>
					<code>Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns 
					that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their trunk is long and flexible,
					allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches.  </code>
                    
                    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin" target="_blank">The pangolin</a></dt>
                  <code> Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin, and they are the only known mammals with this feature.
				  They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants 
				  and termites which they capture using their long tongues. </code>
                    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colugo" target="_blank">Colugo</a></dt>
                    <code>Colugos are tree-dwelling mammals. They reach lengths of 35 to 40 cm (14 to 16 in) and weigh 1 to 2 kg (2.2 to 4.4 lb). 
					They have long, slender front and rear limbs, a medium-length tail, and a relatively light build. The head is small, with large,
					front-focused eyes for excellent binocular vision, and small rounded ears.  </code>
                    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle-faced_bat" target="_blank">Wrinkle-Faced Bat</a></dt>
                    <code>C. senex is tail-less, medium-sized, and generally has a pelage of a drab brown to yellowish-brown colour. They weigh 
					around 17g. Their face is hairless and is covered by convoluted outgrowths of skin
					(as would be expected from the common name).   </code>
                    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus" target="_blank">The Platypus</a></dt>
                    <code> The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown fur that traps a layer of insulating 
					air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a mole. The platypus uses
					its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the Tasmanian devil). </code>
